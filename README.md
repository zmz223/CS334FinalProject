# ML Final Project
**By Zach Zaiman, Mert Ozbay, Niki Vasan**

### Introduction 
This repository contains the code and files from our CS334 Machine Learning course final project. The goal of the project was to work collaboratively in teams to apply machine learning models to a real-world tasks. Our group chose to analyze the effect of confounding variables on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify comorbidities in chest x-rays. We had four main deliverables: 
1. Spotlight Presentation: 90 second elevator pitch to the class that motivates the premise behind our study
2. Code Repository: Train, test, evaluate model and push code + relevant files to github repository 
3. Final Presentation: 5 minute presentation explaining model design, evaluation and results
4. Report: 10+ paged report detailing problem statement, relevant past research, methods, results and key findings of our project

The abstract of our paper is stated below:

### Repo Structure 
* **analysis**: contains for folders for each of the three models with evaluation plots for each strata and final script
* **gradcams**: contains config file, training code and example gradcams (under `gradcams_out`)
* **reports**: contains final presentation slide deck and final report 
* **runs**: contains output directory for each CNN version trained (message authors for weights)
* **trainlib**: contains training code, config file and data prep file
